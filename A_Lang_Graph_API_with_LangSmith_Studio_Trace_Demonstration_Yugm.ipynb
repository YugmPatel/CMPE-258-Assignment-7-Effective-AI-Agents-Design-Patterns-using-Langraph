        "\n",
        "2. **Tool-Using Agent**  \n",
        "   - Calls external tools/APIs dynamically to enhance its reasoning or capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**  \n",
        "   - Combines specialized agents working together in a shared workflow or dialogue.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Planning Agent**  \n",
        "   - Uses planning steps to break down complex tasks into sub-goals and executes them iteratively.\n",

His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, achieved the first great unification in physics and established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for formulating infinitesimal calculus, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz. Newton contributed to and refined the scientific method, and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science.\n",
            "In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. He used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity. Newton solved the two-body problem, and introduced the three-body problem. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Alexis Clairaut, Charles Marie de La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems. He was also the first to calculate the age of Earth by experiment, and described a precursor to the modern wind tunnel.\n",
            "Newton built the first reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. His work on light was collected in his book Opticks, published in 1704. He originated prisms as beam expanders and multiple-prism arrays, which would later become integral to the development of tunable lasers. He also anticipated wave–particle duality and was the first to theorize the Goos–Hänchen effect. He further formulated an empirical law of cooling, which was the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of convective heat transfer, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notions of a Newtonian fluid and a black body. He was also the first to explain the Magnus effect. Furthermore, he made early studies into electricity. In addition to his creation of calculus, Newton's work on mathematics was extensive. He generalized the binomial theorem to any real number, introduced the Puiseux series, was the first to state Bézout's theorem, classified most of the cubic plane curves, contributed to the study of Cremona transformations, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and also originated the Newton–Cotes formulas for numerical integration. He further initiated the field of calculus of variations, devised an early form of regression analysis, and was a pioneer of vector analysis.\n",
            "Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge; he was appointed at the age of 26. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. He refused to take holy orders in the Church of England, unlike most members of the Cambridge faculty of the day. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death.

            "Summary: A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing takes advantage of this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern \"classical\" computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications.\n",
            "The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in classical computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, a state that is in an abstract sense \"between\" the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.\n",
            "Quantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing  scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).\n",
            "In principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than computability, and quantum complexity theory shows that some quantum algorithms are exponentially more efficient than the best-known classical algorithms. A large-scale quantum computer could in theory solve computational problems that are not solvable within a reasonable timeframe for a classical computer. This concept of additional ability has been called \"quantum supremacy\". While such claims have drawn significant attention to the discipline, near-term practical use cases remain limited.\n",

            "1.  **Choose a Platform & Define Scope:** Select a chatbot platform (e.g., Dialogflow, Rasa, or even a simple Python library like ChatterBot). Define the *specific* task your chatbot will perform (e.g., answering FAQs about a product, scheduling appointments, or telling jokes). Keep the scope very limited for your first chatbot.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Design the Conversation Flow:** Map out the basic conversation flow.  Think about the questions users might ask and the corresponding answers your chatbot should provide. Create a list of intents (what the user *wants* to do) and entities (the *details* the user provides).\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Implement & Test:**  Use the chosen platform to implement your conversation flow. Train the chatbot with sample phrases related to each intent. Thoroughly test the chatbot with different user inputs to identify areas for improvement and refine its responses.\n",

            "7.  **User:** \"Compare a Poodle and a Labrador\" (Intent: Compare_Breeds, Entity: Dog_Breed = \"Poodle\", Dog_Breed = \"Labrador\")\n",
            "8.  **Chatbot:** \"Sure! Poodles are generally considered more hypoallergenic and require professional grooming, while Labradors shed more and are known for their love of retrieving. Labradors are typically higher energy than poodles. Would you like a more detailed comparison?\"\n",

            "**Implementation & Testing Process:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Dialogflow Setup:** Created a new Dialogflow agent.\n",
            "2.  **Intent Creation & Training:**\n",
            "    *   Created intents for:\n",
            "        *   `Greetings` (e.g., \"Hi\", \"Hello\", \"Good morning\")\n",
            "        *   `BookAppointment` (e.g., \"I want to book an appointment\", \"Schedule a time\")\n",
            "        *   `CancelAppointment` (e.g., \"I need to cancel my appointment\", \"Remove my booking\")\n",
            "        *   `CheckAvailability` (e.g., \"Are there any slots open?\", \"What's available?\")\n",
            "        *   `GetLocation` (e.g., \"Where are you located?\", \"Address?\")\n",
            "        *   `Default Fallback Intent` (for handling unknown inputs)\n",
            "    *   Added training phrases to each intent (around 10-20 for each).\n",
            "    *   Configured parameters for `BookAppointment` (e.g., `date`, `time`, `service`).\n",
            "3.  **Response Configuration:**  Defined responses for each intent.  For example:\n",
            "    *   `Greetings`: \"Hello! How can I help you today?\"\n",
            "    *   `BookAppointment`: \"What date and time would you like to book your appointment?\" (collecting parameters)\n",
            "    *   `CancelAppointment`: \"Could you please provide your appointment details so I can cancel it for you?\"\n",
            "    *   `CheckAvailability`: \"Please specify the date you're looking for.\"\n",
            "    *   `GetLocation`: \"We are located at [Your Clinic Address].\"\n",
            "    *   `Default Fallback Intent`: \"I'm sorry, I didn't understand. Could you please rephrase?\"\n",
            "4.  **Testing:** Used the Dialogflow simulator and real-world testing with various inputs:\n",
            "    *   **Positive Tests:** Tested with phrases directly related to training data.  Verified correct intent matching and response.\n",
            "    *   **Negative Tests:** Intentionally used misspelled words, incomplete sentences, and ambiguous phrasing to test robustness.\n",
            "    *   **Edge Cases:**  Tried phrases that were similar to multiple intents to see if the intent matching was accurate.\n",
            "    *   **Parameter Extraction:** Tested different date and time formats to ensure parameter extraction worked correctly.\n",
            "    *   **Conversation Flow:** Tested multi-turn conversations (e.g., booking an appointment and then asking to change it).\n",
            "\n",
            "**Brief Result:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The initial implementation successfully identifies basic intents like greetings and simple appointment booking requests.  However, testing revealed the following:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Limitations with Ambiguity:** The chatbot struggles with ambiguous requests or phrases that are only slightly different from the training data.\n",
            "*   **Parameter Extraction Issues:**  Parameter extraction for date and time can be unreliable with certain input formats.\n",
            "*   **Lack of Context:** The chatbot forgets the context of the conversation in multi-turn interactions. It needs to be improved to remember previous answers and user information.\n",
            "*   **Fallback Handling:**  The fallback intent is triggered frequently, indicating a need for more training data and potentially additional intents.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Next Steps (Based on Testing):**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   Add more diverse training phrases, including variations and common misspellings.\n",
            "*   Improve parameter extraction using entities and regular expressions.\n",
            "*   Implement context management to maintain the conversation flow.\n",
            "*   Refine the fallback intent response to be more helpful.\n",
            "*   Consider adding more specific intents based on observed user input.\n"
